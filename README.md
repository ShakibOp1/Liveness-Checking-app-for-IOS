Identity verification must be secure and effective in our constantly changing digital environment. Our research, "Liveness Checking" is at the center of this technological confluence that has resulted in unique methods for identity identification.


Traditional identity verification techniques are no longer as effective in the digital era due to
new dangers. The first part of our initiative, "Liveness Checking," forays into uncharted
territory by putting a focus on in-the-moment communication during authentication.
Approaches relying on static images in the past are susceptible to deception. Our system, in
contrast, relies on dynamic evaluations to guarantee the presence of a living person,
strengthening the security of identity verification procedures.
